      {"timestamp": "00:00:14", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I'm sorry to hear that. I'd be happy to help you figure out what's going on. Can I have your account number or the phone number on the account?", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:00:22", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "It's 555-234-8877.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:00:26", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Perfect, thank you. Let me pull up your account... Okay, I have you here, John Smith. I can see your account. Let me look at your current bill.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:00:38", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Yeah, I usually pay around 90 dollars but this month it's over 150! I didn't change anything with my plan or add any services.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:00:48", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I understand your concern. Let me check the charges breakdown on your current bill... Okay, I can see your bill is $156.43 this month.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:00:58", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Right! What happened? That's like $65 more than normal.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:01:04", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Let me look at the details... I see the issue. You have $67.44 in international roaming charges on this bill. Did you travel outside the United States recently?", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:01:16", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Oh! Yes, I went to Canada for a few days earlier this month. I didn't know there would be roaming charges though. I thought Canada was included.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:01:26", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I can understand the confusion. Your current plan, the Unlimited Plus, does include coverage in the US, but international roaming, including Canada, is not included and charges do apply.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:01:38", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Oh man, I had no idea. So what exactly am I being charged for?", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:01:43", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Let me break it down for you. During your trip from May 8th to May 12th, you used 2.3 gigabytes of data, made 47 minutes of calls, and sent 23 text messages while in Canada. The total for those charges is $67.44.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:02:02", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Wow, that's expensive! I was only there for a work conference. Is there anything that can be done about this?", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:02:10", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I completely understand your frustration, especially since you weren't aware of the charges. Let me see what I can do for you as a valued customer.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:02:20", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "I appreciate that. I've been with you guys for over three years.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:02:25", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "I can see that, and we really appreciate your loyalty. Here's what I can do - I can apply a one-time courtesy credit of 50% of those roaming charges, which would be $33.72. That would bring your bill down to $122.71.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:02:42", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Oh, that would be really helpful! Thank you so much.", "delay": 2},

      {"timestamp": "00:02:55", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Great, thank you. Is there a way to avoid this in the future if I travel again?", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:01", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Absolutely! For future trips, we have a TravelPass option that's $10 per day when you're traveling in Canada or Mexico. It gives you unlimited talk, text, and use of your plan's data allowance while you're there.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:16", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "That's much better! How do I add that?", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:20", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "The great thing is you don't need to add it in advance. It automatically activates when you use your phone in a TravelPass country, and you're only charged for the days you actually use it.", "delay": 3},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:32", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "Oh perfect! So if I had had that, my five-day trip would have cost me $50 instead of $67?", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:39", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Exactly right! And you would have had access to all your normal plan features without worrying about individual charges.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:47", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "That's really good to know. I travel to Canada a few times a year for work, so I'll definitely use that next time.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:55", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "Perfect! Is there anything else I can help you with today, John?", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:03:59", "speaker": "CUSTOMER", "text": "No, that's everything. Thank you so much for your help and for that credit. I really appreciate it.", "delay": 2},
      {"timestamp": "00:04:05", "speaker": "AGENT", "text": "You're very welcome! I've added notes to your account about the TravelPass option for your future reference. Your new bill of $122.71 is due on May 30th.", "delay": 2},
